## Skills

#### Fast learning and adaptibility

I have organised numerous events in both a professional and voluntary capacity for the purposes of charitable fundraising or politics. These events have spanned simple young-people orientated bake sales and sponsored events to visits from political party leaders. I've had to use a range of skills and pick up new information and systems quickly in order to accomplish this.

I've had to:
* Learn my way around new CRM systems on a professional and voluntary basis
* Learn the ropes of the UK political system locally and nationally (I didn't even know what a hustings was when I first got involved).
* Learn how to use social media to set up events, pages and groups. Create online polls and surveys. Increase online volunteer engagement.
* Rebranded two local young activist groups to increase community identity and engagement.
* Learn how to be a youth worker with no prior experience working with children and young people in detached environments. I ended up planning and leading my own sessions within a few months.
* Organised a variety of charitable and political events. Descriptions and evidence below.

- As a temp worker and zero-hours worker I have had to learn new skills and systems quickly and effectively. This includes voluntary transport coordination for vulnerable people, data collection and equipment monitoring for renewable energy generation, chocolate tempering, navigating new medical record management systems, and sex and relationship education presentation skills.
- As a youth-worker I helped collate data and organise successful charitable events for the National Citizen Service (NCS) programme with young people.
- As previous Co-ordinator of Mid and East Cornwall Green Party I have organised small political meetings and gatherings, as well as beach cleans, volunteer support for stalls at Cornwall Pride, and social events for the youth branch of the Green Party. 
- I have organised, within the space of one week, a whirlwind visit to Cornwall by Natalie Bennett, where she visited 4 locations in one day. This included a successful press release, a visit to the Eden Project, visits with local marine conservationists and crowdfunding entrepeneurs, a fundraising pub quiz meet and greet, and free room and board for Natalie. I also organised a talk on the EU during the referendum campaign.
