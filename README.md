## Imogen Kutz

I have retrained as a software developer because I've found coding to be highly addictive. I've always wanted to learn to code and now I can't stop! I enjoy generating creative solutions to practical problems and having so much scope for learning. I hope to get stuck into projects that generally make people's lives simpler and happier, whilst providing an interesting challenge. My experience outside of code is pretty broad. I've been involved in politics, sex and relationships education, youth work, admin work, charity work, and community services, not including my experiences as a temp worker. AMA.

## Skills

#### Fast learning and adaptibility

* I have a very broad background of experiences. I don't think I can stress this enough. I have learned the ropes in all kinds of environments from factory work, youth work, admin work, transport coordination, politics and events organising, to name a few. I learn by throwing myself in the deep end, asking questions, and tracking down the most effective resources.

#### Attention to detail

* From checking minutes and press releases, to clerical work, to the scientific background of my degree, I am comfortable meticulously analysing my work and isolating problems.

#### Experience in leadership roles

* I have previously taken on leading roles in local Green Party activites in the South West (Coordinator for Mid and East Cornwall Green Party, Treasurer for Cornwall Young Greens, Co-convenor for South West Young Greens). I enjoy working in teams and I'm not afraid to speak up if things seem to be steering off course.

#### Skilled organiser

* I have organised events in short time frames, with tiny to non-existent budgets, catering for a variety of needs. I understand that better planning means fewer problems down the road and when applied to code this helps create cleaner, more flexible solutions.

#### Proud feminist and social activist

* I am very passionate about fostering inclusive spaces that allow people the freedom to contribute in a safe and welcoming environment and ensuring marginalised voices achieve necessary parity, be it in a group, community, or the wider world.
