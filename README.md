## Imogen Kutz

I am a fundamentally hopeful person determined to contribute to positive social change before I become maggot food. So far I have helped raise a few thousand pounds for various charities, helped raise money and resources for homeless shelters by volunteering and collecting clothing and toiletry donations, and I've made and sourced various things for Cornwall Children's Clothes Bank. I'm looking for a reliable career that keeps me on my toes in a challenging and diverse environment, and I'd like my work to provide creative solutions to practical problems or just make people's lives that much simpler and happier.

## Skills

#### Events Organising

I have organised numerous events in both a professional and voluntary capacity for the purposes of charitable fundraising or politics. These events have spanned simple young-people orientated bake sales and sponsored events to visits from political party leaders.

- As a youth-worker I helped organise successful charitable events for the National Citizen Service (NCS) programme with young people. As previous Co-ordinator of Mid and East Cornwall Green Party I have organised small political meetings and gatherings, as well as beach cleans, volunteer support for stalls at Cornwall Pride, and visits from Green Party Leaders. 

- I have organised, within the space of one week, a whirlwind visit to Cornwall by Natalie Bennett, where she visited 4 locations in one day. This included a successful press release, a visit to the Eden Project, visits with local marine conservationists and crowdfunding entrepeneurs, a fundraising pub quiz meet and greet, and free room and board for Natalie. I also organised a talk on the EU during the referendum campaigns.
