## Imogen Kutz

I am a fundamentally hopeful person determined to contribute to positive social change before I become maggot food. So far I have helped raise a few thousand pounds for various charities, helped raise money and resources for homeless shelters by volunteering and collecting clothing and toiletry donations, and I've made and sourced various things for Cornwall Children's Clothes Bank. I'm looking for a reliable career that keeps me on my toes in a challenging and diverse environment, and I'd like my work to provide creative solutions to practical problems or just make people's lives that much simpler and happier.
